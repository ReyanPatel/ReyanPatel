Hello, I'm Reyan Patel, and I'm in 8th grade. This github repository shows my journey through all the projects I have been doing (and eventually will do). Here are a few things about me:

- I love coding (Especially ML)
- I love drawing cartoons and paiting in watercolor
- I raise an art stall to fundraise community shelters for animals
